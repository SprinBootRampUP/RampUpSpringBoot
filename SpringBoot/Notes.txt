Topics to Cover

Transactional Annotation




JPA entity

@Entity
@Table(name="")
@Column(name="")
@Transient - fields won't persist to table



Use "Integer" instead of "int" in entities
Default value of int is 0 and Integer is "null"
In row insertion  JPA checks the table with the ID value, if it is 0(default)- it won't find it
but if Id is null , insertion occurs

     - LocalEntityManagerFactoryBean / LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean
